### Description

This project has some HTML and CSS styling provided by Udacity to display a static version of the landing page. The goal of this project is to convert this landing page from a static page to an interactive page where the JavaScript is created dynamically.

### Comments

This project was a challenge to get started, but once momentum was gained and the script was built it was a lot of fun to work on.
